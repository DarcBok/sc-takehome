## Comments and Explanations

### Component 1

#### Comments

In order, the code does the following:

1. The main function creates a `folders.FetchFolderRequest` request pointer, using the `DefaultOrgId` defined in `static.go`.
1. It then calls the `folders.GetAllFolders` method with the request pointer.
1. The `GetAllFolders` method then calls the `FetchAllFoldersByOrgId` method, with the `OrgID` which it extracts from the request pointer.
1. `FetchAllFoldersByOrgId` will get the sample data in `sample.json` by calling the `GetSampleData()` method in `static.go`, and then loop through this data to find the entries that match the given `OrgId`.
1. These entries are collected in a slice and returned to the main function, which will pretty-print this slice.

In short, the code tries to collect the folders where the `org_id` field matches the `DefaultOrgId`, and print them out in a slice.

However, due to an error in `GetAllFolders`, the output prints the final matched entry repeated by the number of matches. This is because in the second loop, the code appends the memory address of `v1`, and not the actual folder's memory address. Since `v1` is reassigned at every iteration of the loop, it eventually contains the final value that was assigned to it, which is repeatedly printed by the main function.

#### Improvements

- Initially, the code cannot be run. By reading the error messages in the terminal when running `go run main.go`, we can see this is due to unused variables.
  - Improvement: Comment out unused variables, and use `_` in junk loop variables.
- There is no need to have the two loops in the `GetAllFolders` method, which seems to just dereference the pointers in the slice, and then convert them back into pointers. Firstly, it introduces the bug discussed above, and secondly, we can just return the output from `FetchAllFoldersByOrgId`, formatted into the required struct type.
  - Improvement: Directly return the output from `FetchAllFoldersByOrgId`.
- `r` and `ffr` are non-descriptive variable names in `GetAllFolders`, making code harder to understand. `GetAllFolders` is also not a good description of what it actually does.
  - Improvement: Rename `r` to `folders`, `ffr` to `response`, `GetAllFolders` to `GetAllFoldersByOrgId`. Also, changed the declaration and initialization of `response` to be in-line.
- Errors unused in `GetAllFolders` and `FetchAllFoldersByOrgId`. It is not possible to return errors anywhere right now, but we might as well make use of error returned from `FetchAllFolderByOrgId` if the method is extended in the future.
  - Improvement: Propagate the error into the return of `GetAllFolders`. Also, remove unused variables in `GetAllFolders`.
